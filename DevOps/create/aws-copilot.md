## Setup

Create a new Copilot app and first ECS service. Do not deploy a test environment.

`copilot init`

To create an environment. Do not deploy environment yet.

`copilot env init`

Create your service

`copilot svc init`

Create RDS storage

`copilot storage init`

After storage yml file is created add this line for encryption.
```
apiclusterDBCluster:
	StorageEncrypted: true
```
Deploy the storage with the environment and not the workload.

`copilot env deploy`

Deploy the service

`copilot svc deploy`

## Setup Gotchas

Try and initially deploy an ECS service that does not require other services to pass the ALB health check.

Take note existing ALB and ECS cluster cannot be used.

Do you need to 

## CodePipelines

This won't create your pipeline, but it will create some local files under copilot/pipelines that will be used when creating your pipeline.
`copilot pipeline init`

Add the Codepipeline manifest files to the repo.
`git add copilot/ && git commit -m "Adding pipeline artifacts" && git push`

Creates a CodePipeline in the same account and region as your application and kicks off a pipeline execution.
`copilot pipeline deploy`

## CodeBuild

For Nodejs 14:

Codebuild environment Ubuntu standard 5.0

```
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 14
```

For Nodejs 16

Codebuild environment Amazon Linux standard 4.0

Codebuild environment Ubuntu standard 6.0
```
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 16
```
Define codebuild environment in manifest.yml
```
build:
  image: aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:4.0
```

## Parameter store environment variable file

Use input.yml file to upload environment variables to AWS parameter store.

`copilot secret init --cli-input-yaml input.yml`

input.yml
```
<secret A>:
  <env 1>: <the value of secret A in env 1>
  <env 2>: <the value of secret A in env 2>
```
manifest.yml
```
environments:
    dev:
      secrets: 
        API_BASE_URL: /copilot/copilot-app/environment/secrets/API_BASE_URL

```
If you need the environment variables to be baked into the build the add them to the buildspec.yml

buildspec.yml
```
version: 0.2
env:
  variables:
    COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME: copilot-app
    COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME: staging	
  parameter-store:
    NODE_ENV: /copilot/copilot-app/environment/secrets/NODE_ENV
```
