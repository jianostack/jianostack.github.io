# RDS Snapshots in pipelines

RDS database snapshots are now taken during the build stage of the production pipelines. It will be stored on AWS until a user removes it. 

Create a new CodeBuild project with the buildspec.yml below and add it to your production pipeline.

buildspec.yaml
```
version: 0.2

phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - aws rds create-db-snapshot --db-instance-identifier name-of-dbinstance --db-snapshot-identifier name-of-dbinstance-$CODEBUILD_START_TIME
      # - aws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot --db-cluster-identifier name-of-cluster --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier name-of-cluster-$CODEBUILD_START_TIME
```

Add a new inline policy to the Codebuild IAM role
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:AddTagsToResource",
                "rds:CreateDBClusterSnapshot",
                "rds:CreateDBSnapshot"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## AWS Copilot
Use the same service role for your CodeBuild project as the one created by AWS Copilot's CodeBuild project! Make sure you do not allow CodeBuild to modify this service role (checkbox).

## Restoring RDS snapshots
Snapshots are taken of the entire RDS instance. The snapshot can be restored back into the same VPC with all the network settings intact.
