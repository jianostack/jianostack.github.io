# AWS ECS Fargate

**Why Fargate?**

A serverless compute engine offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for deploying and managing containers. Basically AWS helps manage the servers and container orchestration while we can focus on the application code.

**What is the advantage?**

Allows more resources to be focused on the application code rather than infrastructure.

**Alternatives?**

ECS Fargate is part of our baseline tech stack that we provide to our clients. ECS EC2 launch type is the alternative offered by AWS and offers more control over the infrastructure. It allows the system architecture to have specific networking or customization requirements, manual server management and scaling. This is suitable for larger, complex applications.
