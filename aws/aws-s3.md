# S3 Create a bucket
While creating the bucket there are two kinds of access, ACL and policies.

ACL deals with Amazon account access and policies cover the rest.

You can skip ACL and policies during creation, just take note of the bucketâ€™s ARN first.

**S3 Create bucket policy**

Find a policy from [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html)

**S3 Create IAM user**
Allow an IAM user to access a bucket.

Below is a version of [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-policies-s3.html#iam-policy-ex0) user policy that only allows programmatic access:

```

   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:PutObject",
            "s3:PutObjectAcl",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:GetObjectAcl",
            "s3:DeleteObject"
         ],
         "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
            ]
      }
   ]
}
```
